  	If checked, patterns defined in sub jobs of the MultiJob will be considered when determining which jobs to be executed.
	This is only valid if ALL paths in a commit are covered by patterns.
	Example, a commit affects paths:
	<br/>
		a/b/c
	<br/>
		a/d/e
	<br/>
	Say we have a large number of sub jobs but the paths above are only affecting one sub job each. Then there is no need to execute the others.
	Then define exclusive regex patterns for the two jobs that are unique:
	<br/>
		Job A: "a/b/.*"
	<br/>
		Job B: "a/d/.*"
	<br/>
	- and only the jobs A and B will be executed.
	If another change (/a/f/g) would be present, then ALL jobs will be executed since we do have exclusive paths for the whole change set.
