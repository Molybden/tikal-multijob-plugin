  	If checked, patterns defined in phase jobs of the MultiJob will be considered when determining which jobs to be executed.
	This is only valid if ALL paths in a commit are covered by patterns.
	Example, a commit affects paths:
	<br/>
		project1/src/integTest/java/com/acme/test/testOne.java
	<br/>
		project2/src/integTest/java/com/acme/test/testSomethingElse.java
	<br/>
	Say we have a large number of sub jobs but the paths above are only affecting one phase job each. Then there is no need to execute the others.
	Then define regex patterns in the commit path field for the two jobs:
	<br/>
		Job-One: "project1/src/integTest/java/.*"
	<br/>
		Job-Two: "project2/src/integTest/java/.*"
	<br/>
	- and only the jobs Job-One and Job-Two will be executed.
	If another change (project1/src/main/java/com/acme/product/Main.java) would be present that is not covered in a phase job config,
	then ALL jobs will be executed for the whole change set.
